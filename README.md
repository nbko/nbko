## Hi, I'm Bonnie Ko

, MongoDB, and SQL. I’m currently learning a bit of RAG and Finetuning, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges and projects.

I’m a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Chicago and enjoy learning through building and problem solving.

I worked as a Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services and previously interned as a full stack software engineer at FPT Software.

I build full stack applications with TypeScript, React, Next.js, JavaScript, and Python, and I work with AWS services like Bedrock, Lambda, Amplify, S3, DynamoDB, and SES.

I also built and deployed a website for an NFT project using Next.js and Vercel: [lavavoila.xyz](https://www.lavavoila.xyz/)

I’m always excited to take on new challenges and build things people actually use.
