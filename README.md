I'm studying Computer Science at University of Chicago, and I have a strong passion for learning and problem-solving. This past summer, I worked as a Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon Web Services. In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to intern at FPT Software as a full-stack software engineer.

I have experience in full-stack development, including TypeScript, React, Next.js, Python, and MongoDB. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and projects.
