I'm studying Computer Science and Computational and Applied Mathematics at UChicago, with a strong passion for learning and problem-solving. In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to intern at FPT Software as a full-stack software engineer.

I have experience in full-stack development, including TypeScript, React, Next.js, Python, and MongoDB. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and projects.
